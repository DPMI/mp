MP Installation
---------------

Software requirements:
 - [optional] autotools
 - GNU make
 - pkgconfig
 - libcap_utils
 - libmarc
 - [optional] libpcap
 - [optional] endace DAG

0. autoreconf --install
   If installing directly from subversion, autoreconf must be run once to
   generate the neccesary autotools files. (Hint: if you extracted a tarball you
   wont need this step)

   Note: the command is autoREconf, not autoconf.

1. mkdir build && cd build
   [optional] Create an out-of-tree build directory. This is just to make it
   easier to have multiple builds and won't bloat the source-tree with binary
   blobs and generated files.

2. ../configure
   Run the configuration script. Use --help for full list of options.
   By default it builds only with the RAW socket drivers.

   If the required libraries is installed to a non-standard location (such as a
   custom prefix) the enviroment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH must point to
   $prefix/lib/pkgconfig or you must set the required CFLAGS/LIBS variables
   manually.

   By default it also uses silent build rules, to override either disable with
   --disable-silent-rules or use `make V=1` later.

3. make
   Build the software.

4. make install
   [optional] Installs the software to the selected prefix (e.g /usr/local)
